Fast Track Kicthen. A Virtual Reality training simulator for fast food employees.

This VR game was made to accomplish the assignment of BACS3063 Virtual Reality in TARUMT.
Currently, restaurant industry currently relies heavily on on-the-job (OTJ) training to train new employees, where the new trainees are supervised by their trainers that guide them how to do their tasks such as cooking, preparing food and serving customers. However, OTJ training causes problems for restaurants as they come with several drawbacks.

To address this problem, a virtual reality (VR) training game can be developed to provide new staff with a simulated restaurant environment where they can learn and practice various skills and scenarios. This VR training game would allow new staff to experience real-life scenarios and learn how to handle them without the pressure of real customers.

Below shows a very short demo gameplay of the game.
